# Rosette

So, prior to this assignment, I have never used Racket or any other Lisp like language. So this was a bit different. My time spent on this assignment was largely me learning the basics of Racket and reading a bit about Rosette. The first thing I did was install Dr. Racket (obviously), and then I started to look through the Racket docs to look for code examples and get an idea of how the language works.

After about an hour of this, I had the idea to go take a look at the first few assignments from your 430 class, since they would likely be intro to Racket type assignments. This was true and I read through these assignments and worked on implementing small parts of them to get a better understanding of the language. I spent about 1-2 hours on these assignments.

My time was cut a bit short here as I have been searching for apartments the past few weeks as I am moving in the very near future.
